Files: 
    meta.tntp-ChicagoRegional -- Metadata about the network 
    out.tntp-ChicagoRegional -- The adjacency matrix of the network in whitespace-separated values format, with one edge per line
      The meaning of the columns in out.tntp-ChicagoRegional are: 
        First column: ID of from node 
        Second column: ID of to node
        Third column (if present): weight or multiplicity of edge
        Fourth column (if present):  timestamp of edges Unix time
